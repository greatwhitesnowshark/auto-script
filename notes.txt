Known Bugs - 

	- Need to add handling for Item Scripts
	- Need to determine when the script is transferring your field or when its a user doing it
	- Need to end Field Scripts at the end of the direction node
	- Need to add UserEffectLocal and FieldEffect packets
	- Need to update ScriptMessage switch/case section
	- Need to verify if the quest result packets should be in fact coming from the field scripts
	- Could use a better way of determining when a script concludes, just in general. Maybe look for another packet tag
	- Could use some clean-up code for the '...' if any debug booleans are set to true
